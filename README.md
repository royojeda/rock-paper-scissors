# rock-paper-scissors

A rock paper scissors game, initially on the DevTools console only for practicing javascript fundamentals, but later updated to use the HTML body for getting user input and displaying scores, and the winner.

The player picks a hand which can be rock, paper, or scissors while the computer randomly generates their own hand (I promise it's not rigged). The hands are compared according to rock paper scissors rules, and a point is awarded to the winner, with ties not adding any point at all. The competitor to reach five points first is declared the winner, and an option is presented to play again, should the player wish to do so.

The following skills are demonstrated in this project (aside from those already listed in the odin-recipes and landing-page projects):
 - Adapting some common built-in javascript functions for desired use cases
 - Declaring, nesting and using user-defined unctions
 - Incorporating error handling for unwanted inputs
 - Using conditionals and loops
 - Using prompt() for input and initially console.log() for output
 - Using git branches for testing new features
 - Targeting DOM nodes with CSS and relational selectors
 - Using DOM methods for taking user input and displaying output (addEventListener, querySelector)
 - Using arrays and array methods
 - Using arrow functions
 - Altering HTML elements from javascript
 - Modifying CSS styles from javascript (and learning which method works best with GitHub Pages -- It's bracket notation. Dot notation didn't work for me)
 - Using events to trigger actions on the page
